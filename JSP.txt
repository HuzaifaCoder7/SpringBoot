JSP stands for "Java Servlet Page" or "Java Server Page". It is just like Html but it has some additional feature that you can actually
put Java code inside of JSP using "<% />" something like this tag.

In Servlet, we have to create function for every requests and if we do some changes in static content like "out.print('<h1></h1>')" then we
have to recompile and redeploy but JSP remove this headache and we can actually do changes in static content like Html, CSS without recompiling or redeploy.

In JSP, there are tags given below:
--> Declarative-tag:- Used to declare variables and methods and it's syntax is (" <%!	%> ")
--> Scriptlet-tag:- Used for java source code like using 'out.println' function and it's syntax is (" <%	%> ")
--> Expression-tag:- Used to directly print the variable or method output and it's syntax is (" <%=	%>" )
